Boredom (with capable restrains[^1] to non-useful entertainment[^2]) seems to be a reasonably good path to what many would call productivity[^3] - though not in the truest sense of the word.

[^1]: Capable restraints, in their simplest form, are things/systems that inhibit your ability to access non-useful entertainment, through the past of least resistance. Meaning that they are not the *discipline* to not grab your phone and watch YouTube, they are the thing that makes it (close to) impossible for you to, even if you wanted to. 

[^2]: Think of non-useful entertainment as anything content you wish you didn't consume after consuming it, generally including things like TikTok, Reels, (most) Youtube videos, social media, etc... A better definition is probably; *Entertainment that is used as cure to boredom, loneliness, or a shortcut to turning off your mind.*

[^3]: I don't think I have ever actually gotten into a *true* state of productivity, rather what I meant by "many people would call", are activities that would be commonly defined as more "productive" or "better" by the general population (especially by your parents). Think reading > TV, exercise > videogames, etc...
